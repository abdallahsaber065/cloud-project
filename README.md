## üåü Features

- **Simple Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design for uploading files through a web browser
- **Secure File Storage**: All files stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets
- **Temporary Download Links**: Time-limited secure links for file sharing
- **File Management**: View, search, and delete your uploaded files
- **File Type Filtering**: Support for common file types (images, documents, PDFs, etc.)
- **User Feedback System**: Built-in feedback mechanism for user suggestions and issue reporting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

This application uses a multi-tier AWS architecture:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Flask templates
- **Backend**: Python Flask web server running on EC2
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 bucket for secure file storage
- **Networking**: Custom VPC with appropriate security groups
- **Security**: IAM roles for secure S3 access from EC2

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Architecture+Diagram)

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on AWS infrastructure:

1. **EC2 Instance**: Hosts the Flask web application
2. **S3 Bucket**: Provides scalable object storage for files
3. **IAM Role**: Grants EC2 instance secure access to S3 resources
4. **Security Groups**: Control network traffic to the application

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your EC2 instance:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdallahsaber065/cloud-project.git app
   cd app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   export S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"
   export AWS_REGION="your-aws-region"
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   # For development
   python app.py
   
   # For production (using Waitress)
   waitress-serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 app:app
   ```

5. Access the application through your EC2 instance's public IP or domain.

## üîí Security Considerations

- Files are stored privately in S3 and accessed via time-limited presigned URLs
- EC2 uses IAM role for S3 access (no hardcoded credentials)
- Security groups restrict network access to the application
